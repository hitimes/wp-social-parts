wp-social-parts
===============

Social Sharing template part and associated files for WordPress.

```custom-functions.php``` is a function you can put in your ```functions.php``` file. We just break ours out into a few different partials. The function itself adds meta tags to the header, and pulls in the title, description and image dynamically based on the post.

This little plugin has some extras that work great with [zemplate](https://github.com/zenman/zemplate), but will of course work without it. Be sure to read the comments in the sass before compiling.
